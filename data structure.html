<h3>what is data structure?</h3>
<h3>1.data structures are essential components that help organize and store data.</h3>
<h3>2.they provide a way to manage and manipulate data.</h3>
Well, What is Data Structure, Anyway?<br>
Before defining data structures, let’s back up a little and ask,<br> 
“What is data?” Here’s a quick answer: Data is information optimized for <br>
processing and movement, facts and figures stored on computers.<br>
Data structures are a specific way of organizing data in a specialized format<br>
 on a computer so that the information can be organized, processed, stored,<br>
 and retrieved quickly and effectively. They are a means of handling information,<br>
 rendering the data for easy use.<br>
Every application, piece of software, or programs foundation consists of two components:<br>
 algorithms and data. Data is information, and algorithms are rules and<br>
 instructions that turn the data into something useful to programming.<br>
Put another way, remember these two simple equations:<br>
Related data + Permissible operations on the data = Data Structures<br>
Data structures + Algorithms = Programs<br>

Characteristics of Data Structures<br>
Data Structure is the systematic way used to organise the data. The characteristics of Data Structures are:<br>
Linear or Non-Linear
This characteristic arranges the data in sequential order, such as arrays, graphs etc.<br>
Static and Dynamic
Static data structures have fixed formats and sizes along with memory locations. <br>
The static characteristic shows the compilation of the data.<br>
Time Complexity
The time factor should be very punctual. <br>
The running time or the execution time of a program should be limited.<br> 
The running time should be as less as possible. The less the running time, the more accurate the device is.<br>
Types of Data Structurev<br>
Basically, data structures are divided into two categories:<br>
Linear data structure<br>
Non-linear data structure<br>
Let's learn about each type in detail.<br>

Linear data structures<br>
In linear data structures, the elements are arranged in sequence one after the other. <br>
Since elements are arranged in particular order, they are easy to implement.<br>
However, when the complexity of the program increases, <br>
the linear data structures might not be the best choice because of operational complexities.<br>
Popular linear data structures are:<br>
1. Array Data Structure<br>
In an array, elements in memory are arranged in continuous memory. <br>
All the elements of an array are of the same type. <br>
And, the type of elements that can be stored in the form of arrays is determined by the programming language.<br>
